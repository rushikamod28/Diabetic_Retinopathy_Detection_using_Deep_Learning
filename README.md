# Diabetic_Retinopathy_Detection_using_Deep_Learning
Developed a deep learning model using EfficientNetB0 to classify diabetic retinopathy into five stages from retinal images. Used Dask for large dataset handling, transfer learning for training, and integrated the model into a Streamlit app for instant predictions.
